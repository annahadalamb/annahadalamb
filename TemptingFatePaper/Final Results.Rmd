# Primary Analysis (Two-Tailed Wilcoxon Tests)

Since we are running three Wilcoxon tests, the null and alternative hypotheses are the same for each test. That is:

**Null Hypothesis:** The medians of the two populations are equal (median1 = median2)

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The medians of the two populations differ (median1 â‰  median2)

## H1: Replication Control vs. Extension Control

The median of the control (have read, no prime) group was 7, whereas the median of Treatment 1 (have not read, no prime) was 6. A Wilcoxon Test revealed a p-value equal to 0.9641. Because this is greater than alpha = 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

```

## **H2: Religious Prime vs. Extension Control**

The median of Extension Control was equal to 6, whereas the median of Religious Prime was 3. A Wilcoxon Test revealed a p-value equal to 0.04339. Because this is less than alpha = 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. Subjects who received an implicit religious prime were significantly less likely to believe a negative outcome was likely (being called on by the teacher in class) than those who did not receive a prime.

```{r}

rel_notread <- temptfate2 %>% filter(relprime == 1 | treatment == "notread")

rel_notread  %>% group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(likelihood),
            median = median(likelihood),
            sd = sd(likelihood),

rel_notread %>% group_by(treatment) %>% get_summary_stats(likelihood, type = "median_iqr")

relvsnotread <- wilcox.test(likelihood ~ treatment, data = rel_notread, alternative = "two.sided", exact = FALSE, conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
relvsnotread

#creating boxplot of religious prime versus control
compare_means(likelihood ~ (treatment), data= rel_notread, method = "wilcox.test", paired = FALSE, adjustment = "holmes")

#forced order so 'not read' is on the left

                     method = "wilcox.test",

  labs(x= "Condition", y= "Perceived Likelihood of Negative Outcome") + theme_classic()

```

## **Hypothesis 3: Superstitious Prime vs. Extension Control**

The median of Treatment 1 was equal to 6, whereas the median of Treatment 3 (superstitious prime) was 7. A Wilcoxon Test revealed a p-value equal to 0.6297. Because this is greater than alpha = 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Our results suggest that increasing the salience of a superstitious worldview does not impact the tempting fate effect, and does not make people more risk averse or risk seeking. This contradicts previous research that found that superstitious primes including words such as "lucky", "destiny" and "meant to be" significantly impacted risk preferences (Nguyen, 2012).

In conclusion, our results suggest that superstitious priming had *no* impact on the perceived likelihood of a negative outcome for having tempted fate (Research Question \#3)

# Robustness Check

We ran multiple linear regression as a robustness check for our Wilcoxon Tests to test if having read or not read for class and the presence of a prime significantly predicted the respondent's perception of the likelihood of a negative outcome, as well as controlling for a subject's religious and superstitious beliefs, age, gender and religion. The overall regression was statistically significant (R^2^ = 0.4896, F(15,226) = 14.46, p \< 0.001). It was found that the religious prime significantly impacted a subject's perception of the likelihood of a negative outcome (b = -1.137715, p = 0.011). Those given the religious prime reported they were less likely to be called on than those who did not receive the prime. We found that a person's superstitious beliefs significantly impacted the outcome as well (b = 0.138, p \< 0.001). That is, the higher they scored on the BIGL survey (i.e. held higher superstitious beliefs), the more likely they believed a negative outcome would result from having tempted fate. The remaining results from the other controls can be found in the table below.

```{r}

#Linear regression with controls of GRS and BIGL scores, gender, and religion (theist vs everyone else)
robustness <- temptfate.biglgrs %>% select(id, age, gender, theist, haveread, superprime, relprime, scoregrs, scorebigl, likelihood)

                  "Age", "Gender(Female)", "Gender(Other)", "Theist"))

write_xlsx(robustness, path = "robustnessdataset.xlsx")
```

# Secondary Analysis

We wanted to know if a person's superstitious beliefs impacted the effectiveness of the superstitious prime, as well as if a person's religiosity impacted the effectiveness of the religious prime. To do this, we ran a model to test for interaction effects. However our results found no significance for either interaction. That is, the effect of the superstitious prime on the outcome doesn't change as the BIGL score increases, and the effect of the religious prime on the outcome doesn't change as the GRS score increases.

lr_bg2 <- summary(lm(likelihood ~ haveread + relprime*scoregrs + superprime*scorebigl + age + factor(gender) + factor(theist), data = robustness))
