This project was designed to be an exploration of how to use design thinking tools and methods to reimagine a different future. My group project was looking at the future of financial literacy. Called "Finance Your Lifestyle," my team created a gamified financial education curriculum for high schoolers. This folder includes:
- Storyboards and prototypes of other ideas to improve financial literacy 
- Final presentation with a prototype of the Finance Your Lifestyle app
