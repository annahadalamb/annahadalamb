Project for Design Thinking course entitled "Design for Tomorrow." The topic we addressed was "How do I know it is safe?" and the outcome was a prototype of an app.

This project followed the design thinking process and practices, including interviews and observations; problem definition; ideation; and prototyping and feedback. We learned processes such as journey mapping, affinity clustering, storyboarding, and wireframing, as well as tools such as Figma. 

Our project created an app prototype called DermApp that helps users find skincare products that suit their needs, concerns and skin type based on their personalized profile. 

The folder includes the following: 
- Pictures from the affinity clustering and journey mapping
- Storyboard
- Wireframes
- Final Presentation
- Link to prototype of one interesting function of the app on Figma
